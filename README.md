# Celebrity-Info-Finder-with-Gemini-AI-LangChain-Chains-Memory-
A Streamlit app powered by LangChain and Google Gemini 1.5 Flash that finds information about celebrities, their date of birth, and major world events around their birth year using a multi-step conversational chain with memory.



# Celebrity Info Finder (Gemini + LangChain + Memory + Streamlit)

This project is a simple **AI-powered Streamlit application** that demonstrates how to build a multi-step conversational pipeline using **LangChain** and **Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model**.

The app allows users to enter the name of any celebrity and then automatically:
1. Generates a short description about the celebrity.
2. Finds the celebrity‚Äôs date of birth.
3. Lists 5 major world events that happened around the time of their birth.
